# PwC-Switzerland-Power-BI
I’m really excited to dive into this experience and build my skills in Power BI and digital transformation! Through this journey, I hope to expand my ability to create meaningful data visualizations—not only by learning the technical aspects but also by understanding how to tell a story with data that truly drives decisions. I want to learn how to present data in a way that resonates with clients, helping to uncover valuable insights and patterns.

I’m also looking forward to gaining a better understanding of automation and machine learning, especially seeing how these tools can streamline processes and add value across business services. I’m eager to see firsthand how PwC uses these tools to tackle real-world challenges and to apply that mindset in my own work.

Overall, I’m hoping this experience will give me the hands-on practice to strengthen both my technical skills and strategic thinking, making me better equipped to drive innovation and efficiency in future projects. Thank you for the opportunity—I can’t wait to get started!
